        "Our project is to perform an aproximate reproduction of a paper, which can be found [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0272055), on predicting hypotension during surgery from a combination of signals such as mean arterial blood pressure (ABP), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electroencephalogram (EEG) as opposed to ABP alone.  Predicting hypotension is important because it is correlated with many post operation complications, and is actionable.  Please read the original work if you are interested in more detail!\n",

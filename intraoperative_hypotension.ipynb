        "Our project is to perform an approximate reproduction of a paper, which can be found [here](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0272055), on predicting hypotension during surgery from a combination of signals such as mean arterial blood pressure (ABP), electrocardiogram (ECG), and electroencephalogram (EEG) as opposed to ABP alone.  Predicting hypotension is important because it is correlated with many post operation complications, and is actionable.  Please read the original work if you are interested in more detail!\n",

        "As of the draft on 2024-04-14, we are using what we understand to be a very close replication of the model, with a smaller openly available data set.  Our model currently executes utilizing ABP data from the dataset for predictors and labels, but the EEG and ECG data is randomly created mock data.  The original work also examined more look ahead times.  "
